# VS Code Setup for New Programmars

When one first started to learn programming, it is often a good idea to use a web-based Jupyter Notebook to write code and run it. However, as one's programming skill grows, it is often a good idea to switch to a more powerful IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as VS Code. VS Code is a free and open-source IDE developed by Microsoft. It is a very powerful IDE that can be used to write code in many different languages. It is also very customizable, and it is easy to install extensions to add more features to it. In this tutorial, we will show you how to install VS Code and how to use it to write code in Python.

## Installing VS Code

To install VS Code, go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the installer for your operating system. After the installation is complete, you should be able to launch VS Code from the Start menu.

## Installing Python Extension

VS Code is a general-purpose IDE, and it does not come with any programming language support. To use it to write code in Python, we need to install the Python extension. To do this, open VS Code and click on the Extensions icon on the left sidebar. Then search for "Python" and install the extension.

## Installing Jupyter Extension

Similarly to the Python extension, we also need to install the Jupyter extension to use VS Code as a Jupyter Notebook. To do this, open VS Code and click on the Extensions icon on the left sidebar. Then search for "Jupyter" and install the extension by Microsoft.

## Creating a New Jupyter Notebook

To create a new Jupyter Notebook, click on the File icon on the left sidebar and select "New File". Then, click on the "Jupyter Notebook" icon on the top right corner of the window. This will create a new Jupyter Notebook file. You can then write code in the notebook and run it. 

You can choose the kernel that you want to use to run the code. To do this, click on the "Select Kernel" button on the top right corner of the window. Then, select the kernel that you want to use.

For me is the base conda environment that has jupyter packages, so I select the Python 3 (ipykernel) kernel.
