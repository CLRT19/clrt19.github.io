# VS Code Setup for New Programmars

When one first started to learn programming, it is often a good idea to use a web-based Jupyter Notebook to write code and run it. However, as one's programming skill grows, it is often a good idea to switch to a more powerful IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as VS Code. VS Code is a free and open-source IDE developed by Microsoft. It is a very powerful IDE that can be used to write code in many different languages. It is also very customizable, and it is easy to install extensions to add more features to it. In this tutorial, we will show you how to install VS Code and how to use it to write code in Python.
