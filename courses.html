              Professor Caglar Uyanik explains concepts really well, he also did
              tons of preparation for the class. Everything feels natural guided
              by his teaching. Most of the concepts are rigorous, which is
              amazing considering this is an intro course. The homework are fun
              and challenging. It is 5 credit course, so workload is heavier
              than normal 3 credits courses. Exams are easier than the homework.
              I got 100% on the First midterm and the Final, and 71/75 in the
              second midterm.

              This is the first formal CS courses I've taken. We use java as
              programming language. The concepts are all pretty simple. If you
              are not into a CS major, I would recommend you to take CS 320
              which use python and covered more data structure and concepts. I
              had Hobbes LeGault as my instructor. She is energetic and
              listening to her class is fun. Her office hour is also super
              helpful, there are tons of students everytime. Most of the
              questions in the exam are covered in class, pay attention to the
              class and you will get a good grade. I got 92.5 on the first
              midterm, 100 on both the second midterm and the final.

              This is course covered the fundamentals of how naive computer
              works. You will learn things from the logic structures to cpu and
              memory. Theoretically, one will be able to build a LC-3
              tutor/simulator in Minecraft after taking this course. Homeworks
              has a few questions, but counts towards a huge amount of grade, so
              pay attention to each homework. There are extra credits at the
              end, so getting an A shouldn't be hard. At the end of the course,
              Professor Skrentny gave us a speech which can really light up
              one's interest in computer engineering. This is the course that
              make things that feels like magic not magical any more.

              Most of the time in this course, you will need to deal with demand
              and supply curves. Personally, I think this course is pretty easy.
              All you need to do is fully understand the basic concepts and you
              are good to go. The discussion session will offer you plenty of
              practice. There is little homework assigned. I recommend to take
              this 4-credits course for your social science requirement, and
              this course will also offer you lots of useful knowledge.

              It is in fact an online course. From time to time, there will be

              This is another java based programming courses. In this courses,
              we introduced more data structure, and algorithms. For example,
              hashtable, red black tree, and Dijkstra's Algorithm. The course
              also cover some basic knowledge of bash command, git and some
              javascript. Overall a useful course, projects are all group
              projects. You will need to design and finish a project using the

              four.

              I don't recommend you take this course before CS 354 unless you
              have prior knowledge of C/C++. Since most of the classmates took
              CS 354 before this class, my instructor assume that we know things
              related to C, but I don't at all. Segmentation fault is annoying,
              it is overall a frastruating experience if you don't know anything
              realted to C or C++ before. The course is similar to CS 300,
              except you only got one course every week, and more projects, and
              C++ is harder than java.

He has a strong math background, explains things super well and clear. To be honest, I haven't seen any other CS professor teach as well as him. He also takes efforts after class, gives long post on piazza, holds review sessions. Lots of students from other sections come to his section, because he teaches so well. I would recommend anyone to take this course. It is a great intro course to lots of concepts in AI.

The lecture and exams are well-made, but the homework is not closely related to the lecture or the exams. Our instructor is Professor Robert Nowak, he also lecture really well and clear. Lectures and exams are mostly related to math. The section I took is at 8:00 am, no recording is given. I feel bad about not attending every lecture because of the time. Professor Nowak is really friendly and fun, I heard that during the pandemic time. He gave lecture with natural landscape as background. The resources are limited if you want to self-study this course. I also feel like the course need an update, because the homeworks and projects are not as good as CS 540. I would recommend you to take CS 540, if you only want to take one AI related course.

We see a probability proof of Weistress theorem at the end of the class, which we also proved in the analysis class.
